# AI-Powered Educational Tutor: Learning Accelerator

An intelligent educational tutor powered by Groq's ultra-fast inference capabilities that provides personalized, real-time learning assistance across multiple subjects through text, audio, and visual inputs.

## Project Overview

The AI Learning Accelerator is a web application that leverages artificial intelligence to provide personalized tutoring across various subjects:

- Mathematics: Step-by-step problem solving with visual explanations
- Programming: Code analysis, error detection, and optimization suggestions
- Science: Interactive explanations of concepts with visual aids
- Language Arts: Grammar correction, writing assistance, and vocabulary building

## Features

### Multimodal Input Processing
- **Text Recognition**: Students can type questions or upload written work
- **Image Processing**: Scan handwritten math problems, diagrams, or graphs
- **Voice Interaction**: Ask questions verbally for a natural learning experience

### Real-Time Feedback System
- Instant assessment of student work using Groq's low-latency processing
- Personalized feedback tailored to individual learning styles
- Progress tracking and adaptive difficulty adjustment

### Interactive Learning Elements
- Visual concept demonstrations using dynamically generated graphics
- Voice-guided tutorials with natural, conversational interactions
- Gamified learning challenges to boost engagement

## Technical Implementation

- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion for animations
- Backend: Node.js server with Groq API integration (future implementation)
- Responsiveness: Fully responsive design for all device sizes
